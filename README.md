## 1.1 Problem

In recent years, there has been a growing trend of integrating technology into schools. This trend has been accelerated by the lasting impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and the continuous advancements in digital devices and tools. Schools across the nation have adopted computers, tablets, and virtual learning platforms to enhance education and increase accessibility in the pursuit of modernizing the classroom. While these technologies offer incredible benefits, they also introduce challenges, particularly in elementary school classrooms. 

One of the most critical problems is the effect screen time is having on students. By incorporating technological devices in classrooms, students are spreading prolonged periods interacting with screens. Studies have begun to highlight how this excessive screen time can lead to a severe lack of social skills, shorter attention spans, and higher frequencies of disruptions. These trends contribute to a less effective and unhealthy learning environment. Furthermore, studies are exploring connections between prolonged exposure to screens and decreases in mental and physical well-being. Therefore, in the pursuit of generating a more social, engaging, and nurturing environment for young students we propose the desk learning aid device.

## 1.2 Solution

The desk learning aid device will function through various buttons and a scroller connected to a customized PCB device. These buttons and the scroller will correspond to responding to polls/questions, comprehension checks, asking questions, and more. The device will communicate to an application that can be monitored by the teacher where they will receive real-time feedback. The teacher can have a better understanding of the student’s comprehension levels and be able to properly cater towards providing the students the most effective lesson. The purpose of this device would be to provide a cost-effective solution that can be set up at each student’s desk to promote a stronger and healthier learning environment for students. This differs from other options on the market due to easier set up because other options require you to create a question in order to receive a response, however, our device allows for many passive inputs including comprehension and other urgent needs. In addition, other portable solutions require students to buy each device individually costing them hundreds of dollars, but our solution only requires the purchase of a reusable RFID keycard that is cheap and easy to use.
